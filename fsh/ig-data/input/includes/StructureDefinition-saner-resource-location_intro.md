The Resource Location profile describes the essential characteristics of the Location resources that are associated
with a Bed (e.g., as a parent location) via Bed.location:partOf or a device via Device.location:partOf.
Locations conforming this profile generally have a physical address, can be located
on a map, and have associated contact information associated with them that aids public
health in coordination.

Sometimes beds and other devices may not have this information associated with them.
Facilities may be temporary, there may not be time to configure systems to report all
of the details for hastily constructed temporary accommodations, et cetera.  For this
reason, the address, GPS coordinates and contact information are not required by this
profile, but it is expected that for normal (e.g., permanent fixtures) this information
is generally available.
