#### Hospital Beds
The "All Hospital Beds" measurement does not include both "available" and "in use" beds, and so would not normally be considered to be a
capacity measurement, however, it is included with other measures that clearly provide an approximation of the in use and available beds.
The Bed Venn Diagram below illustrates stratification of beds such that all desirable capacities can be determined from the measure.
