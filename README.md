## About This Guide
This is a draft implementation guide to promote discussion with leaders in the Health
IT industry, and very much a work in progress.  All content in this guide is subject
to discussion and change.

The goal of publishing this guide is to encourage the creation of a community interested
in extremely rapid development of interfaces that can support communication Bed and other
resources to Public Health in this time of crisis.

This implementation guide provides the FHIR Implementation materials associated with
the SANER project.

The [Continuous Integration Build](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-saner/) is available.
