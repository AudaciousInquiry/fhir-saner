  "description": "The description below includes text from CP-QRPH-238. The normative text describing this code system can be found at\nhttps://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/QRPH/IHE_QRPH_Suppl_ADX.pdf#page=78\n\nThe representation of age group ranges code should be unambiguous, human readable and machine-readable. There being no commonly\navailable coding system or convention for expressing or representing age ranges for aggregate data exchange, ADX expresses an\nage group band through two simple durations as defined in the ISO 8601. The definition below provides the grammar for a coding\nsystem.  The URL for this Coding System is [http://profiles.ihe.net/fhir/CodeSystem/IHE_ADX_agerange](./CodeSystem-IHE-ADX-agerange.html) (for use in HL7® FHIR®),\nand the OID is 1.3.6.1.4.1.19376.1.7.3.1.1.29.1 (for use in HL7® CDA® and Version 3 standards).\n\nADX describes an age group range as two durations:  <duration1> -- <duration2>. Where duration1 specifies the beginning of the\nage group band (everyone who is this age and above) and duration2 signify the upper bound of the age group band.\nTherefore, age groups like \"1-9 years\" means everyone who is at least one year old and less than 10 years old represented as\nP1Y--P10Y,age group like \"10-14 years\" means everyone who is at least 10 years old and less than 15 years old is represented\nas P10Y--P15Y.\n\nDurations define the amount if an intervening time between two time points. These durations are represented in the\nform P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S or P[n]W. The [n] is replaced by the value for each of the time elements that follow\nthe [n] and the letters have the meaning:\n\n* P is the duration designator (for period) placed at the start of the duration representation.\n* Y is the year designator that follows the value for the number of years.\n* M is the month designator that follows the value for the number of months.\n* W is the week designator that follows the value for the number of weeks.\n* D is the day designator that follows the value for the number of days.\n* T is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation.\n* H is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of hours.\n* M is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of minutes.\n* S is the second designator that follows the value for the number of seconds.",
