The Bed Group profile describes the key characteristics associated with a group of beds with
similar features important for tracking for public health.  These features were identified
based on prior efforts to support communication of situational awareness, and include:

* Whether the bed is in use or could be put to use
* The types of service available to a patient in that bed (e.g., ICU, ED, Psychiatric
  precautions, Isolation, et cetera).
* The physical location (i.e., building or physical address) where the bed is found.
