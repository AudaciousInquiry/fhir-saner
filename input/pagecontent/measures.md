According to The American HeritageÂ® Stedman's Medical Dictionary:
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
measure <i>v.</i>
</dt>
<dd>
To ascertain the dimensions, quantity, or capacity of.
</dd>
<dd>
To mark, lay out, or establish dimensions for by measuring.
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

At its simplest, measurement is counting in units, and then doing some math with
the resulting count or to obtain a value that lets you do something useful.

The focus of this guide is to inform developers on how to create and use the essential FHIR
Resources necessary to support national and regional reporting efforts on COVID-19 to
public health officials in the United States.

Over the last decade, HL7 and its members have been deeply involved in the evolution
of quality measurement, from early efforts in developing the [HL7 Version 3 Health Quality Measure Format](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=97)
specification, to more recent efforts in the publication of the [HL7 FHIR Quality Measure (QM)](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/),
and the [DaVinci Data Exchange For Quality Measures (DEQM)](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-deqm/)
implementation guides. These guides provide excellent reference and background materials
for those interested in learning more about the terminology used in measurement.

This implementation guide uses the [MeasureReport](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/MeasureReport)
resource to report measures to regional and federal agencies, including state departments
of public health, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.  In late March of this year, the CDC [published a form](https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/covid19/57.130-covid19-pimhc-blank-p.pdf)
and [instructions](https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/covid19/57.130-toi-508.pdf) for hospital reporting of
bed and ventilator utilization, and FEMA [provided a spreadsheet](Template for Daily Hospital COVID-19 Reporting.xlsx) it expects to be
emailed on a daily basis from in-hospital laboratory testing facilities.  Examples of
these documents are provided below.

<table><caption>Samples of requested data. Show for illustration, please use
official sources for reporting.</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><img width='80%' src='Template-for-Daily-Hospital-COVID-19-Reporting.png'/></td>
  <td><img width='80%' src='57.130-covid19-pimhc-blank-p.png'/></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Each of the entries in these spreadsheets or forms is measure or count of groups
of things such as available beds, ventilators, tests ordered, et cetera.  The completed
spreadsheet or form is a Measure Report.  Accompanying instructions describe (to a human)
what to include in a group.  A conceptual model of these artifacts appears below.

The HL7 FHIR standard has similarly named resources that perform the same functions.
A more detailed model about how these are related follows.
[MeasureReport](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/MeasureReport)
[Measure](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/Measure)
[Group](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/Group)

## Approach 1
Approach 1 describes each reported value in the spreadsheets as a separate measure.
This provides an advantage in that individual values can be accessed, but makes
reporting more complex, and duplicates information.

### CDC Measures
The CDC defined 13 fields (Measures) to report. The fields can be reported by uploading
a CSV file to the CDC reporting application.  These have all been defined using the
FHIR Measure resource in this guide.

#### Measure Definitions (Keith)

[numTotBeds](Measure-SANERnumTotBeds.json.html)
: Total number of all Inpatient and outpatient beds, including all staffed,ICU, licensed, and overflow (surge) beds used for inpatients or outpatients

[numICUBedsOcc](Measure-SANERnumICUBedsOcc.json.html)

: Total number of staffed inpatient ICU beds that are occupied

[numICUBeds](Measure-SANERnumICUBeds.json.html)

: Total number of staffed inpatient intensive care unit (ICU) beds

[numBedsOcc](Measure-SANERnumBedsOcc.json.html)

: Total number of staffed inpatient beds that are occupied

[numbeds](Measure-SANERnumbeds.json.html)

: Inpatient beds, including all staffed, licensed, and overflow (surge) beds used for inpatients

[numC19HospPats](Measure-SANERnumC19HospPats.json.html)

: Patients currently hospitalized in an inpatient care location who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19

[numC19MechVentPats](Measure-SANERnumC19MechVentPats.json.html)

: Patients hospitalized in an NHSN inpatient care location who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and are on a mechanical ventilator

[numVentUse](Measure-SANERnumVentUse.json.html)

: Total number of ventilators in use

[numVent](Measure-SANERnumVent.json.html)

: Total number of ventilators available

[numC19HOPats](Measure-SANERnumC19HOPats.json.html)

: Patients hospitalized in an NHSN inpatient care location with onset of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 14 or more days after hospitalization

[numC19OverflowPats](Measure-SANERnumC19OverflowPats.json.html)

: Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who are in the ED or any overflow location awaiting an inpatient bed

[numC19OFMechVentPats](Measure-SANERnumC19OFMechVentPats.json.html)

: Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who are in the ED or any overflow location awaiting an inpatient bed and on a mechanical ventilator

[numC19Died](Measure-SANERnumC19Died.json.html)

: Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who died in the hospital, ED, or any overflow location

[CDC MeasureReport Bundle](Bundle-FHIR-2.json.html)

### FEMA Measures
FEMA defined 9 fields (Measures) to report for in-hospital labs. The fields are reported by emailing
a spreadsheet to a FEMA e-mail address.  These have also been defined using the FHIR Measure resource
in this guide.  Unlike CDC, FEMA did not provide a CSV format with computable column names. This
specification borrowed names from similar measures used by [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/us-daily/)
used in that projects [CSV API](https://covidtracking.com/api/) for US Historical Data,
or *invented* names where no such name existed.

#### Measure Definitions
Measure definitions for the FEMA Measures follow.

[totalTestResultsIncrease](Measure-SANERtotalTestIncrease.json.html)

: New Diagnostic Tests Ordered/Received

[totalTestResults](Measure-SANERtotalTestResults.json.html)

## Approach 2
Approach 2 collects related reported values in the spreadsheets into single measures.
Items are grouped based on where they are being reported and what they are counting (Beds, Vents, Encounters, Labs).
Individual values must now be parsed from the report, but related values are retained
together, and there is less duplication.

### CDC/NHSN Measures
* [Bed Availability and Use Measures](Measure-SANERBeds.json.html)
* [Ventilator Availability and Use Measures](Measure-SANERVends.json.html)
* [COVID-19 Patient Measures](Measure-SANERC19Pats.json.html)
### FEMA Measures
* [Lab Orders and Results Daily Reporting](Measure-SANERC19Testing.json.html)
* [Lab Orders and Results Cumulative Reporting](Measure-SANERC19CumulativeTesting.json.html)

## Approach 3
Approach 3 considers collecting all measures reported to a single agency into a single Measure.
This further simplifies reporting, but causes data loss as it combines ratio, a continuous-variable
measures, losing the ability to accurately describe the type of measure being reported.

This approach might be preferred if topic, scoring, and type were either shifted from Measure to
Measure.group, or replicated in Measure.group with the constraint that you may use one form or the
other, but if using both they must be identical, allowing a measure to have groups with different
topics, scorings and types.
